# sudoku-solver

## What is this?

This is a simple solver for Sudoku, written in C.

Itâ€™s more a proof of concept, really, since it requires you to enter the Sudoku board into the source code as an array of _ints_. That gets us to the to dos:

## To dos

* Reading from file and writing to file.
~~* Generating Sudokus (running the solver on an empty board with a bit of randomness to seed it).~~ DONE!
